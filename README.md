===========

Nodejs, json, mongodb

Add 2 more buttons on to lab 6. One button will read tweets from the twitter API and save them to a collection in mongoDB. The other button will read the tweets from the database collection and display them in a manner similar to that of lab 1. This will make 4 total buttons.
